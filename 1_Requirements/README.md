# Introduction:

Vehicle Parking Management System is based on the concept to generate Parking Vehicle’s records & update it.  Here User can add Vehicle detail (Vehicle Number) in the program and it’s not time-consuming. This System makes easy to store records of each(Arrival & Departures of vehicles). The whole project is designed in ‘C’ language and different variables and strings have been used for the development of this project. This mini project is easy to operate and understand by the users. This simple mini project in C, built as a console application without using any graphics features.

# Features:
* Proper Log-In system.
* Validations.
* Easy to add, retrieve, modify and delete records.
