# Introduction:

Vehicle Parking Management System is based on the concept to generate Parking Vehicle’s records & update it.  Here User can add Vehicle detail (Vehicle Number) in the program and it’s not time-consuming. This System makes easy to store records of each(Arrival & Departures of vehicles). The whole project is designed in ‘C’ language and different variables and strings have been used for the development of this project. This mini project is easy to operate and understand by the users. This simple mini project in C, built as a console application without using any graphics features.

# Research

## Objective
This project focuses on vehicle parking. The operations performed on this system is used to store data and display in appropriate manner. The operation performed on a system are login, no of parked car and scooters.

## Benefits
A user who is working on a laptop or a desktop who would be working on vehicle parking system, can make use of this application as handy. It is easy to store data in matrix form with vehicle number. So that available parking slot can be display easily.

## Features:
* Proper Log-In system.
* Validations.
* Easy to add, retrieve, modify and delete records.

# Defining Our System
